# Wanderlift - Your Ultimate Travel Management Solution
Welcome to Wanderlift, the ultimate travel management system designed to revolutionize how you plan, book, and enjoy your travel experiences. Wanderlift isn't just a platform; it's a seamless integration of cutting-edge technology and intuitive design, crafted to meet the diverse needs of travelers, managers, tour guides, and administrators alike.

## Overview
The travel management system, "Wanderlift," streamlines interactions among the company, managers, tour guides, and customers. Managers curate unique trips, facilitating services such as hotel bookings, car rentals, flights, and exciting activities. Tour guides register within the program to engage in these trips, while customers register to select personalized trips with their designated guides, often receiving exclusive vouchers.

## Manager

In our company, the manager plays a pivotal role in ensuring the travel agency's smooth functioning by overseeing the addition, editing, deletion, and display of various elements including trips, car rentals, airport and flight details, hotels, and activities. They manage interactions with external agencies to secure all the necessary components for an exceptional travel experience, enabling customers to book their tickets seamlessly.
Additionally, the manager has the authority to view and edit their profile. An important aspect of their responsibility involves reviewing tour guide complaints and reassigning alternative tour guides in instances where complaints arise from assigned trips.

## Admin

The admin, acting as the company's IT department, supervises all accounts including managers, tour guides, and customers. Their duties involve managing, adding, removing, and displaying accounts. On certain occasions, they're assigned to create accounts upon service requests from clients who acquired the system. However, the admin doesn't have the privilege to register directly through the system. Yet, if they manage to log in, they can create another admin account. Similarly, managers cannot register themselves but an admin can create a manager account. Their access is confined to viewing accounts and associated information; they are prohibited from direct interactions with the system.

## TourGuide

Our tour guide system offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities, empowering guides to manage trips, review travel history, track earnings, and update profiles effortlessly. With secure registration, trip management features, complaint filing, and robust salary tracking, it ensures a streamlined and efficient experience. The platform facilitates seamless navigation, enabling tour guides to handle essential tasks, view detailed trip histories, and manage profile details with ease.

## Customer

Customers possess the capability to access their profiles and book comprehensive trip packages covering car rentals, hotels, flights, and exclusive activities. Furthermore, they can review their booking history, manage ticket alterations, oversee and adjust travel services, provide feedback post-trip, receive unique vouchers for multiple bookings, and have the freedom to edit their travel services to suit their preferences.

### Wanderlift is more than just a booking platform; it's a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers every user with a range of powerful features and functionalities. Let's explore some key highlights:

## Utilization of OOP Concepts
Wanderlift is built on a foundation of object-oriented programming principles, including:

*Inheritance:* The use of inheritance allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit properties and behaviors from more general classes. For example, different types of trips (e.g., family tours, couple tours) can inherit common attributes and methods from a generic Trip class.

*Polymorphism:* Polymorphism enables the same method to behave differently based on the object calling it. In Wanderlift, this allows for flexible interactions between different types of users (managers, tour guides, customers) and the system.

*Abstraction:* Abstraction helps to hide complex implementation details and expose only relevant information to users. Wanderlift abstracts away the intricacies of travel management, providing users with a simplified interface to interact with the system.
