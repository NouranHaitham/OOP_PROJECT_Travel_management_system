# Overview

The travel management system, "Wanderlift," streamlines interactions among the company, managers, tour guides, and customers. Managers curate unique trips, facilitating services such as hotel bookings, car rentals, flights, and exciting activities. Tour guides register within the program to engage in these trips, while customers register to select personalized trips with their designated guides, often receiving exclusive vouchers.

# Manager

In our company, the manager plays a pivotal role in ensuring the travel agency's smooth functioning by overseeing the addition, editing, deletion, and display of various elements including trips, car rentals, airport and flight details, hotels, and activities. They manage interactions with external agencies to secure all the necessary components for an exceptional travel experience, enabling customers to book their tickets seamlessly.
Additionally, the manager has the authority to view and edit their profile. An important aspect of their responsibility involves reviewing tour guide complaints and reassigning alternative tour guides in instances where complaints arise from assigned trips.

## Admin

The admin, acting as the company's IT department, supervises all accounts including managers, tour guides, and customers. Their duties involve managing, adding, removing, and displaying accounts. On certain occasions, they're assigned to create accounts upon service requests from clients who acquired the system. However, the admin doesn't have the privilege to register directly through the system. Yet, if they manage to log in, they can create another admin account. Similarly, managers cannot register themselves but an admin can create a manager account. Their access is confined to viewing accounts and associated information; they are prohibited from direct interactions with the system.

## TourGuide

Our tour guide system offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities, empowering guides to manage trips, review travel history, track earnings, and update profiles effortlessly. With secure registration, trip management features, complaint filing, and robust salary tracking, it ensures a streamlined and efficient experience. The platform facilitates seamless navigation, enabling tour guides to handle essential tasks, view detailed trip histories, and manage profile details with ease.

## Customer

Customers possess the capability to access their profiles and book comprehensive trip packages covering car rentals, hotels, flights, and exclusive activities. Furthermore, they can review their booking history, manage ticket alterations, oversee and adjust travel services, provide feedback post-trip, receive unique vouchers for multiple bookings, and have the freedom to edit their travel services to suit their preferences.
