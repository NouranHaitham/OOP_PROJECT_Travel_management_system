## Utilization of OOP Concepts 🏗️

Wanderlift leverages object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and scalable system:

- **Inheritance:** We use inheritance to build a hierarchy of classes. For instance, different types of trips like family tours and romantic getaways inherit common properties from a base `Trip` class, allowing for code reuse and flexibility.
- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables the system to handle different user types (managers, tour guides, customers) using a common interface. For example, the method for managing bookings behaves differently based on whether the user is a manager or a customer.
- **Abstraction:** Abstraction simplifies complex systems by exposing only essential features to the users. Wanderlift abstracts away technical details, allowing users to interact with a streamlined interface for managing trips, bookings, and profiles without dealing with underlying complexities.

## Key Features 🛠️
